# Homeworks, Assignments, and Projects

**First Step:** Note that it is the responsibility of all students to familiarize themselves with the 
[Honor Code and Submission Policy](https://github.com/zahta/graph_ml/edit/main/README.md#copyright-honor-code-and-submission-policy) and 
to maintain the highest level of academic integrity.

**Second Step:** Create a GitHub Repository for the course with the name "graph_ml_course_assignments", 
and send its link to the course's group, as soon as possible.

### Assignment Set 1: Deadline 21 Feb 2023 (2 Esfand 1401) at 11:59pm.
  - **Part 1: Python Basics**    
  Do [these Python exercises](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/#python-for-everybody) up to
  the exercise "comparing and sorting tuples", and take a photo from your final score and put it on your GitHub repository of the course.
  - **Part 2: Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib**   
    In each of the following problem sets, do at least 30 exercises (the more, the better). Use Git to save the .ipynb files of your assignments `from Labex to your GitHub repository (with a bonus)`, or use similar .ipynb files that I have already saved to the course repository using Git `(without a bonus)`.
    - [100 NumPy Exercises](https://labex.io/courses/100-numpy-exercises)
    - [100 Pandas Exercises](https://labex.io/courses/100-pandas-exercises)  
    - [Draw 2D and 3D Graphics with Matplotlib](https://labex.io/courses/draw-2d-and-3d-graphics-by-matplotlib)
    
### Assignment Set 2: Deadline 17 Mar 2023 (26 Esfand 1401) at 11:59pm.   

Understanding the concepts of these [two assignment sets](https://github.com/zahta/graph_ml/tree/main/assignments/assignment_set_2) will help you to solve the next assignments. Study the concepts presented in the two assignment sets and execute the codes. Try to understand the concepts correctly by printing the outputs and changing the parameters in each of the code cells.
