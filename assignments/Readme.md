# Homeworks, Assignments, and Projects

**First Step:** It is the responsibility of all students to familiarize themselves with the 
[Honor Code and Submission Policy](https://github.com/zahta/graph_ml/edit/main/README.md#copyright-honor-code-and-submission-policy) and 
to maintain the highest level of academic integrity.

**Second Step:** Create a GitHub Repository for the course with the name "graph_ml_course_assignments", 
and send its link to the course's group, as soon as possible.

### Assignment Set 1: Deadline 21 Feb 2023 (2 Esfand 1401) at 11:59pm.
  - **Part 1: Python Basics**    
  Do [these Python exercises](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/#python-for-everybody) up to
  the exercise "comparing and sorting tuples", and take a photo from your final score and put it on your GitHub repository of the course.
  - **Part 2: Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib**   
  In each of the following sets of exercises, do at least 30 of them (the more, the better). Use Git to save the .ipynb files of your assignments **from Labex to your GitHub repository** (**with a bonus**), or use similar .ipynb files that I have already saved to the course repository using Git (**without a bonus**).
    - [100 NumPy Exercises](https://labex.io/courses/100-numpy-exercises)
